## How to Use This Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is designed to be both a learning resource and a practical reference. Each section contains:

- Conceptual overviews
- Code examples
- Implementation patterns
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid

When working with AI coding assistants, you can reference specific sections of this knowledge base to provide context for your questions or to guide the AI in generating accurate, best-practice code for Supabase-related functionality.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Supabase, start with the [Core Concepts](01-core-concepts.md) guide to understand the fundamental architecture and capabilities. Then, explore specific areas based on your immediate needs.

For setting up a new project, follow this general sequence:

1. Read [Core Concepts](01-core-concepts.md)
2. Set up [Authentication](02-authentication.md)
3. Design your [Database](03-database.md) schema
4. Implement [Security Best Practices](07-security.md)
5. Add additional features as needed (Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime)
